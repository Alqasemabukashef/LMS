ðŸ“Œ Project Name: Library Management System - Database Design

ðŸ“– Description
This project provides a comprehensive database design for a Library Management System, ensuring efficient tracking of books, members, loans, and publishers.

ðŸ“Œ Models Included:
1-Conceptual Model (ER Diagram) â€“ Defines entities, relationships, and key attributes.
2-Logical Model â€“ Converts the ER diagram into tables, columns, primary keys, and foreign keys.
3-Physical Model â€“ Implements the database design in MySQL, including data types, constraints, and indexing.

âœ… Features:
âœ” Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
âœ” Normalized Database Schema (3NF)
âœ” SQL-Compatible Table Structures
âœ” Foreign Key Constraints for Data Integrity
âœ” Indexing for Performance Optimization

Files Included:
ðŸ“Œ LMS_Use_Case.pdf - System Initial Description
ðŸ“Œ er_diagram.drawio.png - Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
ðŸ“Œ logical_diagram.drawio.png - Logical Model Schema
ðŸ“Œ physical_diagram.drawio.png - Physical Model Schema


ðŸ“Œ Tools Used
Diagramming: Draw.io (for ERD)
Database Management: MySQL

ðŸ“Œ How to Use
1-Download the LMS Database Design.drawio file.
2-Review the ER Diagram to understand the high-level structure.
3-Check the Logical Model for a normalized schema (3NF).
4-Implement the Physical Model in MySQL or any DBMS using the SQL structure provided.
5-Feel free to contribute, improve, or expand the database model to fit additional requirements! ðŸš€
